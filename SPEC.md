1. Structured Specifications
  - Problem statement: What problem does this solve?
  - User personas: Who will use it?
  - Core features: Prioritized list (must-have vs nice-to-have)
  - Technical constraints: Language, frameworks, integrations, deployment target
  - Data model: Key entities and relationships
  - API contracts: If applicable, expected endpoints/interfaces
  - Non-functional requirements: Performance, security, scalability needs

2. Examples
  - Input/output pairs
  - User workflows (step-by-step)
  - Mockups or wireframes (I can read images)
  - Reference implementations ("like X but with Y")
